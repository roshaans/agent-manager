![five prompts to five fresh agents without moving the cursor, one per CLI, then the blocked one answered and its diff opened](docs/demo.gif)

Claude Code, Codex, OpenCode, Grok, Gemini CLI, Pi, and Hermes Agent run side by side. Each tool runs in its own persistent tmux session.

agent-manager is a thin layer over the CLIs you already have. Each session launches your own installed tool as-is: your login, your subscription, your config files, your MCP servers, and every feature the tool ships all carry over, exactly as they behave in a plain terminal.

Instead of hunting through terminal tabs to see which agent is done and which is stuck, every session shows up in one list with live status, grouped into a project tree you can fold and reorder. You answer any of them without attaching: `space` sends a prompt straight into a session's pane, or spawns a new agent in the selected group. A dead session revives on its own conversation with `v`. And `ctrl+r` opens a full-file diff of what an agent changed, syntax-highlighted, where the comments you leave on lines go back to the agent's pane as one review prompt when you press `C`.

Press `f` on a session to continue its conversation in a separate named fork.

The tools you use alongside agents live in the same list: `T` opens a plain shell tab in the selected group for builds, Git, and one-off commands.

Not here yet: cost tracking, mouse-driven navigation, and agents that can talk to each other.

## Supported tools

Status detection supports **Claude Code**, **OpenCode**, **Codex**, **Grok Build**, **Gemini CLI**, **Pi**, and **Hermes Agent** by default. Other CLI tools can run as sessions. Add a `[tools.<name>]` block to give another tool live status rules (see [Configuration](docs/configuration.md)).

## Install

Runs on macOS and Linux, and on Windows inside [WSL2](docs/install.md#windows).

### Homebrew (macOS / Linux)

```bash
brew install yoanwai/tap/agent-manager
```

Installs tmux with it if missing. The tap ships a cask, so an install from the older formula switches over with `brew uninstall agent-manager` followed by the command above.

### Install script (macOS / Linux)

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/YoanWai/agent-manager/main/install.sh | sh
```

Downloads the latest release for your platform, verifies it against the published checksums, and installs it to `~/.local/bin`. Set `AGENT_MANAGER_INSTALL_DIR` for another directory and `AGENT_MANAGER_VERSION` to pin a version. Install tmux with your own package manager.

Arch Linux, mise, `go install`, prebuilt binaries, Windows (WSL2), and updating: [docs/install.md](docs/install.md).

## Usage

```bash
agent-manager
```

Sessions run inside tmux (`am_*` namespace), so they survive the manager quitting. Inside a session, **Ctrl+Q** detaches back to the manager when your terminal and tmux leave it available; **Ctrl+\\** is an alternate under the same rule. **Ctrl+R** opens the session's diff review and **Ctrl+O** opens its directory in your editor. In a full-screen attach, the session footer also shows an inner tmux prefix followed by `d` when configured. When nested inside another tmux, send the inner prefix shown in the footer, then press `d`. If both tmux servers use the same prefix, invoke the outer tmux's `send-prefix` binding; if the outer tmux otherwise captures the inner prefix, configure it to forward that key. `agent-manager --version` prints the version.

Agent sessions live on a private tmux server named `agentmgr`, so they never mix with the tmux you run yourself and a `kill-server` on your own socket leaves them alone. To reach one from a plain shell, name that server: `tmux -L agentmgr ls`, then `tmux -L agentmgr attach -t am_<id>`.

The full reference, every key, the quick prompt, killing and reviving, diff review, groups, status detection, stats, and themes, lives in [docs/usage.md](docs/usage.md). The short version:

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `n` | New session (name, tool, directory, optional starting prompt, group) |
| `space` | Quick prompt: answer the selected session, or spawn an agent in the selected group |
| `enter` | Focus the session in place; keys go to the agent while the list stays |
| `→` / `←` | Step in and out: `→` focuses the session or opens the group, `←` closes the group and, at the start of a focused agent's prompt, comes back to the list. In beta, and Settings can turn the pair off |
| `ctrl+r` | Review the session's changes as full-file diffs; `c` comments a line, `C` sends the comments to the agent |
| `x` / `v` | Kill a session to free its RAM / revive it on its own conversation |
| `R` | Restart a session on an empty context: same name, group, directory and tool, fresh conversation |
| `s` | Settings (default tool, theme or follow the OS light/dark mode, list density, review layout, desktop notifications) |
| `?` | The key map: every binding, grouped and scrollable, with `/` to search it |

A session can spawn into its own git worktree (`<repo>-worktrees/<name>`, branch `am/<name>`), toggled on the `n` form, with `alt+w` in the quick prompt, or by default in Settings.

Configuration (adding your own tools, status rules, revive commands) is in [docs/configuration.md](docs/configuration.md).
