# Configuration

Config lives in your OS user config dir (`~/Library/Application Support/agent-manager/config.toml` on macOS, `~/.config/agent-manager/config.toml` on Linux, with `XDG_CONFIG_HOME` honored when set) and is created on first run with defaults for Claude Code, OpenCode, Codex, Grok Build, Gemini CLI, Pi, and Hermes Agent.

The Pi defaults require Pi 0.76.0 or later because they use `--session-id`.

The Hermes defaults are tested with Hermes Agent 0.20.0 and launch its classic REPL with `--cli`. This keeps the input, approval, and activity markers stable even when your Hermes preference selects its modern TUI.

Top-level: `poll_interval` (default `"2s"`) sets how often panes are polled for status, preview, and stats. `editor` is the command `o` opens a directory in, arguments included (`editor = "code -n"`, `editor = "open -a 'Visual Studio Code'"`); it is run directly rather than through a shell, and quotes group an argument carrying a space. Left unset, Agent Manager falls back to `$AGENT_MANAGER_EDITOR`, then a GUI editor on `PATH`, then `$VISUAL` / `$EDITOR`, then a terminal editor on `PATH` (see [Opening the editor](usage.md#opening-the-editor)).

The generated file also carries a `[tools.terminal]` block. That one is the shell `T` opens, not an agent CLI: an empty `command` leaves the pane on `$SHELL`, and setting one opens a different shell. `shell = true` is what marks it — never the name — so the tool pickers skip it and the keys that write into a pane refuse it (see [Terminal tabs](usage.md#terminal-tabs)). Any block can carry the flag, and a `[tools.terminal]` block already in your own config keeps whatever it already means.

Add any CLI tool as a `[tools.<name>]` block:

```toml
[tools.mytool]
command = "mytool"
default_status = "idle"
rules = [
  { state = "working", pattern = "esc to interrupt" },
  { state = "errored", pattern = "(?im)^\\s*error:" },
]
```

Rules match top-down against the visible pane text; first match wins, and `default_status` applies when nothing matches.

**Status detection.** Optional per-tool fields refine it: `activity_cutoff` (regex locating the tool's input box, everything above it is turn content), `turn_end` (a turn-summary line marking the turn as over), `busy_line` (work that outlives its turn, such as background agents and shells), `limit_line` (a usage or rate-limit banner; the session is `errored`), `chrome_line`, `blocked_line`, and `trailing_note`. `status_source = "claude-hooks"` switches status to Claude Code hook events (see [Status](usage.md#status)). The generated config's `claude` and `opencode` blocks show all of them in use.

**Revive.** `resume_by_id_command` resumes one exact conversation, with `{id}` replaced by the session's captured agent id. That id comes either from launching under an id the manager mints (`session_id_flag`, e.g. `--session-id`) or from reading back an id the tool minted itself (`session_store = "codex" | "opencode" | "gemini" | "hermes"`). `revive_command` is what `v` falls back to when no id is available, e.g. `claude --continue`.

**Forks.** `fork_command` creates a conversation from an existing session. Agent Manager replaces and shell-quotes these placeholders:

- `{id}`: The source conversation ID.
- `{session_file}`: The source conversation's file on disk, for a tool that forks by loading a file (Gemini CLI: `gemini --session-file`). Available with `session_store = "gemini"`.
- `{new_id}`: A new UUID that Agent Manager records for exact revival.
- `{name}`: The new Agent Manager session name.

A `fork_command` references its source through `{id}` or `{session_file}`, so one of those two is required. Claude Code, Codex and Gemini CLI include default fork commands. A custom tool can omit `{new_id}` when its `session_store` captures the generated ID.

**Prompts.** `prompt_flag` controls how the new-session form's optional prompt is embedded into the launch command. Tools that take the prompt as a positional argument (Claude Code: `claude 'the prompt'`) leave it empty; tools whose positional argument means something else declare the flag (OpenCode: `prompt_flag = "--prompt"`, since its positional argument is the project path). `prompt_mode = "send"` handles a persistent CLI that accepts no startup prompt: Agent Manager waits until `activity_cutoff` finds its input box, then submits the prompt there (Hermes uses this). Set it to `"argument"` if a custom Hermes wrapper accepts a launch argument instead. The prompt setting only affects a new launch; revive (`v`) uses the revive commands untouched.

**MCP.** `mcp = "claude" | "codex" | "opencode" | "grok" | "gemini" | "hermes" | "none"` picks how the agent-manager MCP server is registered into the tool's sessions (see [MCP](usage.md#mcp-how-agents-discover-these-commands)). An empty value uses the tool's config key when it names a known style. Hermes registration needs its MCP SDK, an optional part of the Hermes install: when it is missing, the spawn stops and a dialog points at `hermes setup`, which installs it.

State is stored next to the config in `state.db` (SQLite).

## Rules files

`rules_files` names the instruction files a tool reads before its first turn — the ones `i` lists and opens (see [Agent rules](usage.md#agent-rules)). It is unrelated to the `rules` above, which classify pane output; these are what the agent is *told*.

```toml
[tools.mytool]
rules_files = ["MYTOOL.md", "AGENTS.md", "~/.config/mytool/AGENTS.md"]
```

A bare or relative name is a project file, looked for in the session's directory and every directory up to the repository root. A name starting with `~` or `/` is the single copy the tool keeps per machine. A name that would climb above the checkout is ignored, so a spec cannot reach into a shared parent directory. A tool block that lists none is looked up under `AGENTS.md`.

The shipped defaults are `CLAUDE.md`, `CLAUDE.local.md` and `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` for Claude Code; `AGENTS.md` plus `~/.codex/AGENTS.md` for Codex and `~/.config/opencode/AGENTS.md` for OpenCode; `GEMINI.md` and `~/.gemini/GEMINI.md` for Gemini CLI; `AGENTS.md` for Grok, Pi and Hermes. Change the list if your CLI reads somewhere else — nothing else in Agent Manager depends on these names.

## Right-to-left text

A row carrying Hebrew or Arabic can flip a terminal's paragraph direction, and the whole row is then right-justified into the sessions rail. Agent Manager pins such rows left with Unicode direction marks on the hosts that need them, iTerm2 today, detected through `TERM_PROGRAM` and `LC_TERMINAL`.

Other hosts render RTL rows in column without the marks, and a host that runs its own bidi reorders a row that carries them until the frame no longer matches what was painted. Set `AGENT_MANAGER_RTL_PIN=1` to force the marks on, `AGENT_MANAGER_RTL_PIN=0` to force them off.
